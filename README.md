# About CircAssimlate

I’m an Engineering Manager and experienced Tech Lead specialized in iOS, macOS, and web development with proven experience building native and web applications. I’ve led teams of up to 20 engineers, helping them grow and deliver great customer experiences. I work closely with Product and Design to build smart roadmaps that balance new features and technical health.

I get excited about creating [simple, lovable, and complete](https://longform.asmartbear.com/slc/) applications that can turn into powerful products with rapid learning and thoughtful iteration. Here are some things I especially love to do:

- Web Development - Modern web applications, websites, and portfolios
- Slack Platform Apps - Automate team processes and communication
- iOS & macOS Development - applications for the Apple platform
- Artificial Intelligence - The sky is the limit
- Consultation - Technical brainstorming and collaboration
